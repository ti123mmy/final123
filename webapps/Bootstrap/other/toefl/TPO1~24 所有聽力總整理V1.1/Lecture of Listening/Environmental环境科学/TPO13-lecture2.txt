Lecture 2     (ecology)
Narrator
Listen to a part of a lecture in an ecology class.

Professor
So, continuing our discussion of ecological systems--- whole systems. The main thing to keep in mind here is the interrelationships. The species in the system er¡­. and even the landscape itself, they are interdependent. Let¡¯s take what you¡¯ve read for this weekend and see if we can apply this interdependence idea. Mike?

Student
Well, um¡­, how about beavers--- ecosystems with beavers in waterways.

Professor
Good, good, go on.

Student
Like, well, you can see how it's so important, cause if you go back before European settled in North America, like before the 1600s, back when native Americans were the only people living here, well, back then there were a lot of beavers, but later on, after Europeans¡­

Professor
OK, wait, I see where you are heading with this, but before we go into how European settlement affected the ecosystem, tell me this--- what kind of environment do beavers live in? Think about what it was like before the Europeans settlers came, we¡¯ll come back to where you were headed.

Student
OK, well, beavers live near streams and rivers and they block up the streams and rivers with like logs and sticks and mud. You know, they build dams that really slow down the flow of the stream. So then the water backs up, and creates like a pond that floods the nearby land.

Professor
And that creates wetlands. OK, tell me more.

Student
Well with wetlands, it's like there is more standing water, more Stillwater around, and that water is a lot cleaner than swiftly flowing water, because the dirt and settlement and stuff has the chance to sink to the bottom.

Professor
More important for our discussion, wetland areas support a lot more variety of life than swiftly flowing water. For example, there are more varieties of fish or insects, lots of frog spices, and then species that rely on those species start to live near the wetlands too.

Student
Yes, like birds and mammals that eat the fish and insects, and you can get trees and plants that begin to grow near the standing water, that can't grow near the running water. Oh, and there's something about wetland, and ground water too.

Professor
OK, good. Wetlands have a big effect on ground water, the amount of water below the surface of the land. Think of wetlands as, Umm, like a giant sponge, the earth soaks up a lot of this water that's continually flooding the surface, which increases the amount of water below. So where is there a wetland, you get a lot of ground water, and ground water happens to be a big source of our own drinking water today.
All right¡­ So, back to the beavers, what if the beavers weren't there?

Student
You just have a regular running stream, because there is no dam, so the ecosystem would be completely different, there would be fewer wetlands.

Professor
Exactly, so, now let's go back to where you were headed before, Mike. You mentioned the change that occurred after Europeans came to North America.

Student
Yeah, well, there used to be beavers all over the place, something like 200 million beavers, just in the continental United States. But when Europeans came, they started hunting the beavers for their fur, because beaver fur is really warm, and it was really popular for making hats in Europe. So the beavers were hunted a lot, overhunted, they are almost extinct by the 1800s, so¡­ that meant fewer wetlands, less standing water.

Professor
And what does that mean for the ecosystem? Kate?

Student
Well if there is less standing water then the ecosystem can support its many species, because a lot of insects and fish and frogs can't live in running water, and then the birds and animals that eat them, lose their foods supply.

Professor
Precisely, so the beaver in this ecosystem is what we call a keystone species. The term keystone kind of explains itself. In architecture, a keystone in an archway or doorway is the stone that holds the whole thing together, and keeps it from collapsing. Well, that's what a keystone species does in an ecosystem. It's the crucial species that keeps the system going. Now, beaver populations are on the rise again, but there is something to think about. Consider humans as part of these ecosystems, you've probably heard about water shortages or restrictions on how much water you can use, especially in the summer time, in recent years. And remember what I said about groundwater; imagine if we still have all those beavers around, all those wetlands. What would our water supply be like then?
