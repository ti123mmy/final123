Lecture 3     (medieval poetry)
Narrator
Listen to part of the lecture in poetry class, the professor is discussing medieval poetry.

Professor
OK, so the two poems we are looking at today fall into the category of medieval times, which was how long ago?

Student
Almost a thousand years ago, right?

Professor
Yes, that¡¯s right.

Student
But, professor, are you sure these are poems? I mean I thought poems were shorter; these were more like long stories. I mean one of them was all about love, but the other one the Chan¡­Chan¡­whatever it called, the other one; it¡¯s all about fighting and battles. I mean can both of them be considered to be poems?

Professor
Well, think back to the very beginning of this course.

Student
Aha

Professor
Remember how we, we define poetry? In the very broadest sense, we said it¡¯s written to evoke, to make you, the audience, have some kind of the emotional experience through the use of imagery, en, some kinds of predictable rhythm. And usually, but not always, there¡¯s more than one meaning implied with the words that are used. Let¡¯s start with the Chanson poetry first. That¡¯s Chanson. Chanson poem became popular in Europe, particularly in France, and the term is actually short for a longer French phrase that translates to a¡­huh¡­ songs of deeds. Now they were called songs of deeds because strangely enough, they were written to describe the heroic deeds or actions of warriors, the knights during conflicts. We don¡¯t know a lot about the authors, it still contests somewhat. But we are pretty sure about who the Chanson poems were written for. That is---they were written for the knights and the lords---the nobility that they served. The poems were song performed by a minstrel, a singer who travelled from castle to castle, singing to its local lord and its knights. Ah¡­ well, would someone summarize the main features of the Chanson poem you read?

Student
Well, there¡¯s a hero, and a knight, who goes to battle, and he is admired for his courage, bravery and loyalty, loyalty to the royalty serves, his country and his fellow warriors in the field. He¡¯s a, he has a, he¡¯s a skilled fighter, willing to face the most extreme dangers, sacrificial, willing that sacrifice anything and everything to protect his king and country.

Professor
Ok, now be given that the intended audiences for these poems were knights and lords. What can we say about the purpose of Chanson poetry? What kinds of feelings were it meant to provoke?

Student
I guess they must been really appealing to those knights and lords who were listening to them. Hearing the songs probably made them feel more patriotic, made them feel like a good noble thing to serve their countries, and whatever way they could.

Professor
Good, we¡¯ve got a pretty good picture of what the Chanson hero was like. Now let¡¯s compare that to the hero in the other poem. The other poem is an example what¡¯s called Romance Poetry. And the hero in the romance poems was also in knight. But what made the knight in Romance Poetry different from the knight in Chanson poetry. Well, first the purpose of the hero¡¯s actions was different. The hero in the Romance Poetry is independent, purely solitary in a way, not like the Chanson poet who was always surrounded by his fighting companions. He doesn¡¯t engage in the conflict to protect his lords or country. He does it for the sake of adventure, to improve himself, to show his worthy of respect and love for his lady. He¡¯s very conscious of the particular rules of social behavior he has to live up to somehow. And all of these actions are for the purpose of proving that he is an upright moral, well-mannered, well behaved individual. You may have noticed that in Chanson¡¯s poetry there isn¡¯t much about the hero¡¯s feelings. The focus is on the actions, the deeds. But the Romance Poetry describes a lot of the inner feelings, the motivations, psychology you could say, of the knight trying to improve himself, to better himself, so he¡¯s worthy the love of a woman. What it explains this difference? Well, a digging into the historical context tells us a lot. Romance Poetry emerged few generations after Chanson, and its roots were in geographical regions of France that were calmer, where conflict wasn¡¯t central to people¡¯s lives. More peaceful times meant there was more time for education, travel, more time for reflection. Another name for Romance Poetry that¡¯s often synonymous with it is troubadour poetry.
Troubadours were the authors of the new romance poems. And we know a lot more about the troubadours than we do about the Chanson authors, because they often had small biographical sketches added to their poems that gives pretty specific information about their social status, geographical location and small outlines of their career. This information wasn¡¯t particularly reliable because they were sometimes based on fictitious stories, great adventure or the scrape together from parts of the different poems. But there is enough to squeeze or infer some facts about their social class. The political climates have settle down enough so that troubadours had the luxury being able to spend most if not all of their time, creating, crafting or composing their love songs for their audiences. And yes these poems were also songs; many troubadours were able to make a living being full time poets which should tell you something about the value of that profession during the medieval times.
